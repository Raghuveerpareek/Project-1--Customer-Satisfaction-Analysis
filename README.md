# Project-1--Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis
Project to analyse, review and interpret customer experiences and perceptions to make more informed business decisions, identify areas of improvement and maximise customer satisfaction.

Problem:

The primary goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction to identify key factors influencing satisfaction and areas needing improvement. 
This involves:

**Understanding Satisfaction Drivers:** Identifying which aspects (product quality, delivery time, customer service, website usability) most significantly impact overall customer satisfaction.
**Demographic and Behavioral Insights:** Analyzing how satisfaction varies across different demographic groups (age, gender) and purchasing behaviours (purchase amount, frequency, discount usage).
**Loyalty Program Effectiveness:** Evaluating the impact of loyalty program membership on customer satisfaction and retention.
**Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the root causes of dissatisfaction to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing customer experience.
**Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Calculating the NPS to gauge overall customer loyalty and identify areas to convert detractors into promoters.
